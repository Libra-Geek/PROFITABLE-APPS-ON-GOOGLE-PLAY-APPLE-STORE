# Google-Play-and-Apple-Store
An analysis of the most profitable apps on Google Play and Apple Store for English users
- In this project, we will be examining two sets of data containing the list of all mobile applications available for downloads on Google Play and Apple Store.
- We are an English company and invariably, have English-speaking target customers. Therefore, we will analyse our data to check for and extract only those applications which can be used by our target customers.
- After extracting our English apps, we will then select the ones which are profitable and are in high demand by our target customers. In order to have viable results, we need to analyse and check for apps which have the best performance both on Google Play and Apple Store.
